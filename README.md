# LittleLemon Backend Component
### Welcome to LittleLemon! This is the backend component of my project.

## Description
#### LittleLemon is a backend component that provides database management and is responsible for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations necessary for frontend frameworks. It exposes API endpoints to interact with the data stored in the database.

## API endpoints:
- /menu/
- /menu/\<int:pk>\/
- /booking/
- /booking/\<int:pk>\/
- /auth/users/
- /auth/users/\<username>\/

## Webpage(s):
- /

## To generate user-token via insomnia (make sure to use post method):
- /api-token-auth/
